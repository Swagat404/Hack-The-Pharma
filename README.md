# üöÄ Hack-The-Pharma!

Our team, **Hack-The-Pharma**, developed a data-driven solution to **Challenge 1: Predict Kinase Selectivity Using Machine Learning for PharmaHacks 2025**. [Challenge Repository](https://github.com/devpatel30/molecular_forecaster). Our project aims to address critical challenges in pharmaceutical data analysis and molecular property prediction, using Python and R. In drug development üíä, predicting molecular properties is crucial for screening potential drug candidates efficiently. Our solution leverages machine learning techniques to forecast kinase-inhibitor interactions from molecular properties and chemical structures.
